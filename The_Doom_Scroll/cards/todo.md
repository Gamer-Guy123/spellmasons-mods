bloodied takes away 1 stack of each curse from you per cast and transfers it to the enemy
bloodthorn takes none away, but gives double your stacks to the enemy
sterile takes all away and gives them to the enemy

- [x] Pillar on each target
-Earth throw glitches urns out, especially with bloodletting
-Inconsistent projectile spin on earth throw (I would like it to spin every time)
-forwarded target stomp error caught by dorioso
-the arrow spells cost still increase even with endless quiver
-Several Spells have underscores in their names
-Making the blood arrows good and addding branched evolution for it (a new spell plus tweaks to them)
-A new type of pillar called an altar that must be cast on an ally, killing the ally upon summoning but making an altar with half of their health that is permanently target cursed
-pillar disappearing on death 
Tweaks that I don't know how to implement but would want changed if possible:
-make player projectiles ignore pillars like enemy projectiles do
